								<p>
					There is still time for National Basketball Association players to form a team and compete for the United States in Athens this summer, just as there is still time for the players and owners to agree on a deal that would insure labor peace before the current collective bargaining agreement expires on July 1.		</p>
					<p>
					But given the stubborn climate of recent negotiations, neither appears likely. Even with a meeting scheduled for Monday in Manhattan, both sides appear headed toward a long, tense summer of bargaining. With major monetary issues on the table, the league faces the growing possibility of losing games to labor strife for the first time.		</p>
					<p>
					''Eventually, you have to make a deal,'' said Russ Granik, the league's deputy commissioner, who is heading the negotiations on behalf of the owners. ''The only question is when and how much damage you do before you get to that point.''		</p>
					<p>
					Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players' association, proposed last Wednesday that both sides agree to a moratorium rather than the owners' locking out the players. A lockout would prohibit any N.B.A. business between players and teams, meaning the free-agent signing period, set to begin July 1, would be postponed indefinitely.		</p>
					<p>
					But the owners will not accept any deal that allows more contracts or trades to be signed and consummated under the current rules. Barring major concessions, two league officials confirmed Friday, a lockout is imminent.		</p>
					<p>
					Using the world championships in Athens as a platform, the 12 N.B.A. players selected to the team have decided to boycott the games until a labor agreement is reached. USA Basketball, the organization that selects teams for international play, stoked the fires last week, saying it would send another team to Athens.		</p>
					<p>
					There is hope for Grant Hill, Gary Payton and friends to play overseas. FIBA, which oversees international competition, has privately intimated to USA Basketball that it would accommodate last-minute replacements in order to field the best team possible. It is a move that would clear the way for N.B.A. players to decide to compete shortly before the games begin on July 29.		</p>
					<p>
					But while rosters and dates are negotiable, apparently the players are not budging. ''In all probability, if there is a lockout, the players will be inclined to vote not to go,'' Hunter said.		</p>
					<p>
					According to a lawyer familiar with the negotiations, the owners want to install a hard salary cap, essentially a fixed amount each team can spend in a season, without exceptions. Over the next two or three seasons, teams would also like to phase out the Larry Bird exception, in which teams can pay their own free agents whatever they want, regardless of the salary cap.		</p>
					<p>
					For the owners, the ultimate goal is to reduce salaries over a three-year period so that they do not exceed 48 to 50 percent of revenues. They also would like to limit individual salaries so that one or two players do not gobble up all the money on a roster.		</p>
					<p>
					Whereas the owners see their proposals as finally bringing some economic balance to a league of $100 million-or-bust contracts, the players view the approach as taking back what it is already theirs.		</p>
					<p>
					''They're not even on the same planet right now,'' said a union official who requested anonymity.		</p>
					<p>
					The perception among players is that Commissioner David Stern is wedded to the idea that they will give in if they have to miss paychecks. The players'  resolve may indeed be tested.		</p>
					<p>
					Draft Variables		</p>
					<p>
					This is what preparation for the N.B.A. has come to: A guy who had not played five-on-five basketball until two years ago may end up going No. 1 in Wednesday's draft.		</p>
					<p>
					Now hedging on whether they will select Arizona point guard Mike Bibby with the first pick, the Los Angeles Clippers may take the University of Pacific's 7-foot-1-inch Nigerian, Michael Olowokandi, this week in Vancouver, British Columbia. The club is said to be divided on which player it will choose, leaving the door open for the first five or six selections.		</p>
					<p>
					Vancouver, which is said to be interested in taking the Kansas forward Paul Pierce at No. 2, is still entertaining offers from teams for its pick. The Denver Nuggets, who have the third pick, are worried the Toronto Raptors will move up from No. 4 to No. 2 in order to take Olowokandi or Bibby, thus forcing them to take Pierce instead of the big man they covet.		</p>
					<p>
					Kansas' Raef LaFrentz, North Carolina's Antawn Jamison, Vince Carter and the St. Louis shooting guard Larry Hughes all figure to be in the next group of players, along with Michigan's Robert (Tractor) Traylor and Utah's Michael Doleac.		</p>
					<p>
					Filling Out the Bulls		</p>
					<p>
					With the season put on hold, so, too, is the future of the Chicago Bulls.		</p>
					<p>
					Bulls Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf continues to express desire about re-signing Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman to prevent the franchise from falling into immediate decay.		</p>
					<p>
					If Jordan can persuade Pippen to somehow overcome his long-held resentment against management in the next few months or whenever the owners and players settle their labor war, the possibility of a reunion for one more season exists.		</p>
					<p>
					But if Chicago loses Pippen and Rodman -- along with Coach Phil Jackson, as expected -- look for General Manager Jerry Krause to make some kind of push for the free agent Jayson Williams to fill the rebounding void.		</p>
					<p>
					If Chicago could not offer Williams the money the Nets can, it would not be beyond the Bulls to sell their corporate culture to Williams and give him reassurances that he will not retire a poor man. What's more, Toni Kukoc has shown over the past few months that he can pick up much of Pippen's offensive contributions.		</p>
					<p>
					For Jordan to come back, he needs to be convinced he can still compete for a title. If Pippen leaves, acquiring another All-Star in Chicago is the only difference between him staying for one or two more seasons or leaving the game again.		</p>
